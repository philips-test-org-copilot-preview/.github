# Copilot Preview Features Request Management

This repository is designed to streamline user requests for **GitHub Copilot preview features that are not yet enabled across our enterprise**. We understand the value these cutting-edge features can bring to your workflow and are committed to evaluating and potentially integrating them.

When requesting and utilizing these preview features, it's crucial to proceed with **utmost care and diligence**. As they are still in preview:
* They may not be fully stable.
* They could have undocumented behaviors.
* They might not yet adhere to all our enterprise security and compliance standards.

**Always be mindful of the data you are processing and the implications of using features that are not yet officially supported.**
